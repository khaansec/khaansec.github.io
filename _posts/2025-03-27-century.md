Decided to start working through Under the Wire's Century lab.


Level 0
- Given by the website

Level 0 → Level 1

Level 1 → Level 2
- This starts off pretty easy. The password is supposed to be the PS build version (not the overall PS version), so a simple write-host with the env variable for the version should get us going. write-host $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
- Little did i know, however, that there are other specific version attributes. I instead had do display the full table info. echo $PSVersionTable. from there i selected the appropriate value.

Level 2 → Level 3
-for this one, the goal was test your knowledge/teach you the built-in equivalent of wget in linux, then append the name of a file on the desktop.You needed to use the full name of the commandlet, not just the alias.
